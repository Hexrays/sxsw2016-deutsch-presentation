Extreme Science. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope

Developed at NASA's Goddard Space Center
http://jwst.nasa.gov/WebbCamWide/CLNRMR-800px.jpg

So the most interesting thing I saw at SXSW wasn't some epic science-fiction vision into the future. I was an insane look into the past. More than 13.5 billion years into the past.

But we'll get there...


The JWST is the successor to the Hubble

// It's not just an upgraded version of the Hubble


### Slide 4

### Slide 5

For scale, the Hubble is about the size of a school bus and the JWST will be more like a tennis court.

### Slide 6

It's so big that it'll have to be folded up to be put inside a rocket and it'll unfold over the course of it's one million mile trip over 30 days into orbit. It'll also take months to cool down.

### Slide 7

Also interestingly, it won't actually orbit the earth, it'll stay fixed in the same spot in relation to the earth and sun.

### Slide 8

Beryllium mirrors coated with gold for superior reflection.
nearly perfect> if each individual mirror was scaled to the size of the US, and the highest point in the us being about 20,000 feet, the highest bump on this lens would be less than 1 inch high. not to mention that the nerds building them have to account for them changing shape once they cool down to -400 degs Fahrenheit.

### Slide 10

Some nerd stuff:
1 light year is nearly 6 trillion miles
Speed of light is approx â€Ž671 million mph
It takes 8 minutes for light to travel from the Sun to the earth
It takes 100,000 years for light to travel across the Milky Way Galaxy.


### Slide 11

As light waves travel, they stretch out, leaving the visible spectrum and becoming infrared.
The Hubble sees only visible light and UV. The JWST will be able to see infrared light.

### Slide 12

the infrared light will be able to penetrate the dust shroud and reveal what's inside.

When stars and planets are just forming they're hidden behind cocoons of dust and can't be seen with visible light
The JWST will be able to look through the dust so astronomers can learn how planets are formed

### Slide 13

When a planet passes in front of a star, the starlight passes through the planet's atmosphere. Astronomers will be able to capture images with the JWST that allow them to determine atmospheric conditions and look for other earth like planets.

### Slide 14
This is an image taken by the Hubble of stars within our galaxy, which contains a couple hundred billion stars.

### Slide 15

This is part of an image of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field
This is the current limit if the hubble's capabilities.
Every point of light is a galaxy filled with billions of stars

The Hubble can see toddler galaxies where the JWST will see baby galaxies

The JWST will see back in time to the very first galaxies that were born after the big bang over 13.5 billion years into the past

it's there to learn more about how galaxies were formed and evolved over time.

### Slide 16
But one of the most amazing things is that this project
involves more than 1,000 people
in 17 countries
over 2 decades
and costs about 8.7 billion dollars

### Slide 17
Once it's launched, it's orbit is too far away from Earth for repairs to be made.


### Slide 18
So the most interesting thing I saw at SXSW didn't provide any answers it just raised more questions.


### Slide 19
thanks
### Slide 20
info/lanks





Milky Way Galaxy contains a couple hundred billion stars










<!-- they're going to use it to look for Earth like planets -->

to find answers to questions they haven't thought of yet.






thanks
