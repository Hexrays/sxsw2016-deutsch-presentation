    <li>Once it's in space it'll slowly unfold over the course of it's 30 day trip</li>
    <li>about one million miles from earth</li>

    <li>the highest bump on this lens would be less than 1 inch high.</li>

    <li>Lets get into some quick nerd stuff</li>
    <li>Speed of light is approx â€Ž671 million mph</li>
    <li>1 light year is nearly 6 trillion miles</li>
    <li>It takes 8 minutes for light to travel from the Sun to the earth</li>
    <li>If takes about 100,000 years for light to travel across the Milky Way Galaxy.</li>
    <li>As light waves travel, they stretch out, leaving the visible spectrum and becoming infrared.</li>
  </ul>
`;

let slide11 = `
  <ul>
    <li>As light waves travel, they stretch out,</li>
    <li>leaving the visible spectrum and becoming infrared.</li>
    <li>The Hubble sees only visible light and UV.</li>
    <li>The JWST will be able to see infrared light.</li>
  </ul>
`;

let slide12 = `
  <ul>
    <li>the infrared light will be able to penetrate the dust shroud and reveal what's inside.</li>
    <li>When stars and planets are just forming they're hidden behind cocoons of dust and can't be seen with visible light</li>
    <li>The JWST will be able to look through the dust so astronomers can learn how planets are formed</li>
  </ul>
`;

let slide13 = `
  <ul>
    <li>When a planet passes in front of a star, the starlight passes through the planet's atmosphere.</li>
    <li>Astronomers will be able to capture images with the JWST that allow them to determine atmospheric conditions</li>
    <li>and look for other earth like planets.</li>

    <li>This is part of an image of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field</li>
    <li>This is the current limit if the hubble's capabilities.</li>
    <li>Every point of light is a galaxy filled with billions of stars</li>
    <li>The Hubble can see toddler galaxies where the JWST will see baby galaxies</li>
    <li>The JWST will see back in time to the very first galaxies that were born after the big bang over 13.5 billion years into the past</li>
    <li>it's there to learn more about how galaxies were formed and evolved over time.</li>

    <li>involves more than 1,000 people</li>

    <li>over 2 decades worth of work</li>
